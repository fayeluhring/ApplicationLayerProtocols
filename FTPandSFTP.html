  <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
  <p>FTP is one of the earliest and most common forms of transferring files through the internet ("File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in Application Layer", 2024, 1). "FTP is a client server protocol that has two communication channel, command channel, for conversation control and data channel for file content" ("File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in Application Layer", 2024, 6). While FTP is one of the most common forms of transferring files through the internet, it was not designed with security in mind.</p>
<!--We add an image to FTP as well, once again I did a local image as the link would just expire after a certain amount of time.-->
  <img src="images/ftpimage.jpg" alt="Files being Transfered" />
<!--Now we list information about SFTP, which is just the secure version of FTP.-->
  <h2>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</h2>
  <p>SFTP was then created! It is the secure version of FTP. It encrypts your data before sending the files ("File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in Application Layer", 2024, 18). </p>
<!--Adding another list as I followed the exact same layout as HTML, and it works as a summary just in case someone wanted bullet points. I like including these as I am a fast reader who can read bullet points easier.-->
  <ul>
    <li>Two communication channels in FTP</li>
    <li>FTP does not encrypt data</li>
    <li>SFTP adds encryption</li>
    <li>Used widely for secure file sharing</li>
  </ul>
