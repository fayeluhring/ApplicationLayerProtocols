  <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
  <p>FTP is one of the earliest and most common forms of transferring files through the internet (“File Transfer Protocol (FTP in Application Layer”, 2024, 1)). “FTP is a client server protocol that has two communication channel, command channel, for conversation control and data channel for file content” (“File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in Application Layer”, 2024, 6).
