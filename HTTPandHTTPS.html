    <h2>Introduction to HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the same person who created the WWW, in 1989 (Hovemeyer, 2019, 3). His goal when creating HTTP and the WWW in general was to help the online sharing of scientific data (Hovemeyer, 2019, 3). HTTP is based on a client-server model that uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for establishing connections ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13). It "is a stateless protocol, which means the server doesn't maintain any information about the previous request from the client" ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13).  </p>

    <h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>
    <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) was created to make more secure connections ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13). So it's the same as HTTP, just with secure connections. </p>

        <li>Uses TCP for connection</li>
        <li>HTTPS adds encryption</li>
