<!--Now I am going into depth on what HTTP and HTTPS is, I use headers and paragraphs to do this (h2 and p) for HTTP and HTTPS, just a simple page as I don't know how to do anything really extravagant.

    <h2>Introduction to HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the same person who created the WWW, in 1989 (Hovemeyer, 2019, 3). His goal when creating HTTP and the WWW in general was to help the online sharing of scientific data (Hovemeyer, 2019, 3). HTTP is based on a client-server model that uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for establishing connections ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13). It "is a stateless protocol, which means the server doesn't maintain any information about the previous request from the client" ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13).  </p>

    <h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>
    <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) was created to make more secure connections ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 13). So it's the same as HTTP, just with secure connections. </p>
<!--A list was required so I included one on every page almost except of course the main page and the references. I just use ul (unordered list) which means it makes a bullet point list, and li (list item) which is every item inside the list, as that is how you make a basic list.-->
    <ul>
        <li>Client-server communication</li>
        <li>Stateless protocol</li>
        <li>Uses TCP for connection</li>
        <li>HTTPS adds encryption</li>
    </ul>

<!--Now we close off our code, this is something I haven't mentioned yet but that I thought was cool to be honest. Usually when I write code not for websites I do not have to close anything off, but it is cool to see where things start and end.-->
