    <h2>Introduction to SMTP</h2>
    <p>SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is used for exchanging messages via email between servers ("Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)", 2025, 1).</p>

    <h2>How does SMTP work?</h2>
    <p>There are two types of email delivery methods when using the SMTP model, such as end-to-end delivery and store-and-forward. "End-to-end delivery is used between organization. In this method, the email is sent directly from the sender's SMTP client to the recipient's SMTP server without passing through intermediate servers" while "[s]tore-and-forward is used within organizations that have TCP/IP and SMTP-based networks. In this method, the email may pass through several intermediate servers (Message Transfer Agents, or MTAs) before reaching the recipient" ("Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)", 2025, 3).</p>

    <h2>Is there any disadvantages?</h2>
    <p>There are a couple of disadvantages of using SMTP. Some of these would be the common port being blocked by firewalls, security is a big problem, how simple it restricts the usefulness, you can only use 7-bit ASCII characters, SMTP servers may reject entire messages based on length of the mail ("Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)", 2025, 13).</p>
