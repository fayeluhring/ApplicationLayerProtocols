    <h2>Introduction to TELNET</h2>
    <p>TELNET stands for TELetype NETwork ("Protocols in Application Layer", 2024, 3). It originated in the late 1960s, and was created to provide remote access and control over minicomputers and mainframes. It was designed to be simple and secure, which it had to be in order to connect to remote systems("Introduction to Telnet". 2024, 3).</p>

    <h2>Why is it no longer used as much if at all?</h2>
    <p>As security concerns grew and new issues were arising, TELNET couldn't really keep up. "TELNET's use has diminished due to security concerns, and alternatives... are now preferred for secure remote manangement"("Introduction to Telnet", 2024, 3). TELNET was also hard for the beginners, and if you did not have proper interlinking, some capabilities were disabled ("Introduction to Telnet", 2024,11) </p>
<!-- I once again use ul (unordered list) which means it makes a bullet point list, and li (list item) which is every item inside the list, as that is how you make a basic list.-->
    <ul>
        <li>Used for remote connections</li>
        <li>Was secure during the late 1960's</li>
        <li>Was the most popular form of remote connection, however other alternatives are used due to security concerns</li>
        <li>It is also difficult for beginners, and if you had improper interlinking, some capabilities would be disabled</li>
    </ul>
