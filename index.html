        <h2>Executive Summary </h2>
        <p>Application layer protocols are some of the most important components of the computer network. They are at the top of the network protocol stack (Hovemeyer, 2019, 2). “Application layer protocols are those protocols utilized at the application layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/IP (Internet Protocol) models” (“Protocols Application Layer”, 2024, 2). Application layer protocols define how applications communicate with each other on various network devices (“Protocols in Application Layer”, 2024, 2). Without these protocols, applications would not properly communicate with each other, leading to slow downs, improper information, and simply a computer not being able to run correctly.</p>

<!--Now for the table of contents, this lists everything on the index page for an even quicker way to go to each tab. I also put a description under each one so it was clearer what each tab is.I used almost the exact same commands as my navigation, only I used a table on the actual index page instead! I used tr (table row) and td (table data) to make sure everything is perfect with my table.-->
