        <h2>Executive Summary </h2>
        <p>Application layer protocols are some of the most important components of the computer network. They are at the top of the network protocol stack (Hovemeyer, 2019, 2). “Application layer protocols are those protocols utilized at the application layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/IP (Internet Protocol) models” (“Protocols Application Layer”, 2024, 2). Application layer protocols define how applications communicate with each other on various network devices (“Protocols in Application Layer”, 2024, 2). Without these protocols, applications would not properly communicate with each other, leading to slow downs, improper information, and simply a computer not being able to run correctly.
