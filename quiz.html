// Due to my previous classes which gave me experience with if/else questions, this was easy. I just had to figure out the commands to write to get to where I needed to go. I used our class information and Geeks for Geeks and built in copilot for VS for help with definitions ONLY.
// Now, const defines a constant veriable, document.querySelector is a DOM (we just learned this) method that selects the particular element given (question 1) and sees if it is checked/selected. If it is, it moves on and if it is not, it is marked as incorrect/null.
const question1 = document.querySelector('input[name="question1"]:checked');
  if (question1 && question1.value == "1") {
    score++;
    results += "<p>Question 1: Correct</p>";
  } else {
    results += "<p>Question 1: Incorrect (Answer: HyperText Transfer Protocol)</p>";
  }

  // Same thing here with our second multiple choice question. Same exact wording and set up just replacing question1 with question2.
  const question2 = document.querySelector('input[name="question2"]:checked');
  if (question2 && question2.value == "1") {
    score++;
    results += "<p>Question 2: Correct</p>";
  } else {
    results += "<p>Question 2: Incorrect (Answer: Security concerns)</p>";

  // Now this checks if the fill in the blank is correct, .value.trim().toLowerCase gets the current value, trims any unnessecary spaces, and converts it to lowercase. We HAVE to convert it to lowercase so that if someone types for instance: TELNET but I put the correct answer as Telnet, it won't mark it as incorrect, it will still be correct. We do not need it to be case sensitive for this quiz.
  // It is not as complicated as it looks. I put where the hyphen is accepted and also not needed in the name, as it doesn't really matter if the hyphen is there or not, and the lowercase converter wouldn't catch that as an okay. To break down that .replace(/-/g,''). // is a regular expression literal for JavaScript, - is the character to replace, g is a 'global flag' which means it tags all occurances of - in the string, and '' is the replacement, which is nothing. We want it to be able to match my given correct answer in the code. (I felt smart figuring this out.)
  const question4 = document.querySelector('input[name="question4"]').value.trim().toLowerCase().replace(/-/g,' ');

  // This checks the multiple selection answer, question 5 they need to choose multiple answers, so this makes sure both are selected to count as correct. So, it goes through and makes sure all values put as 1 are there, and if the total count at the end is 2, it marks this question as correct. If it is below, it will be incorrect completely. I am not doing half points as it is too complicated but I might in the future if we change this.
  const question5 = document.querySelectorAll('input[name="question5"]:checked');

  }

  // Once again, looks really complicated but is not. I wanted to do something that is different from what I'm assuming a lot of students will do with the pass and fail output, so I did "You...[passed/failed]". This will be the code to display if the user passed or failed, and their total score out of 5. I didn't do a total counter where it shows whatever the total is, as it is consistently 5 questions. 
  //This was also really simple, as I have done if else before in my coding experience, so I just had to learn quiz lingo for this coding system.
  results += `<h3>Total Score: ${score} / 5</h3>`;
